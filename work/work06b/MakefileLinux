# NOTE ON THE USE OF BULLET LIBRARY ON LINUX:
# The linux version of bullet on vcpkg has an issue related to the convolute hierarchy of header inclusions of bullet. See https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/7877 for details.
# As a consequence, to use it on linux the easier solution is: 
# - to use the bullet version installed using sudo apt-get install libbullet-dev. The libraries were copied locally in the repository folder
# - to add an additional include path to point directly to the root of the bullet headers hierarchy

# name of the file

CC = gcc
CXX = g++

# Include paths
IDIR = ../../include/
IDIR_BULLET = ../../include/bullet/ # this additional path is required in order to use bullet


# Libraries path

# compiler flags:
CXXFLAGS  = -g -O0 -x c++ -Wall -Wno-invalid-offsetof -std=c++11 -I$(IDIR) -I$(IDIR_BULLET) # note the additional include at the end

# linker flags:
LDFLAGS = -L$(LDIR) -lglfw3 -lassimp -lz -lminizip -lkubazip -lpoly2tri -lpolyclipping -ldraco -lpugixml -lBullet3Common -lBulletCollision -lBulletDynamics -lLinearMath
